  <p>Abstract
Scrum is one of the agile methodologies designed to manual groups withinside the iterative and incremental transport of a product. Often called “an agile assignment control framework,” its consciousness is on the usage of an empirical technique that lets in groups to reply rapidly, efficiently, and successfully to extrade. Traditional assignment control strategies restore necessities with the intention to manipulate time and value; Scrum on the opposite hand, fixes time and value with the intention to manipulate necessities. This is achieved the usage of time packing containers, collaborative ceremonies, a prioritized product backlog, and common remarks cycles. The involvement of the commercial enterprise for the duration of the assignment is crucial as Scrum is predicated closely at the collaboration among the group and the patron or patron consultant to create the proper product in a lean fashion. This paper offers a top level view of Scrum and its use in assignment control.</p>
<p>What is Scrum?
We ought to first be clean on what Scrum isn&rsquo;t always. There is a not unusualplace false impression that Agile is Scrum. While Scrum is certainly agile, it isn&rsquo;t always the only technique of enforcing agile principles. Scrum is actually certainly considered one among many agile methods to product improvement. Other strategies encompass Extreme Programming (XP), Crystal, Feature Driven Development, DSDM Atern, and so on. All of those strategies adhere to the Agile Manifesto and its related principles. A beneficial metaphor might be to consider Agile as being ice cream, at the same time as Scrum, XP, Crystal, etc., are all actually exclusive flavors, like chocolate, strawberry, vanilla. They are all agile, they&rsquo;re all good, and plenty of may be utilized in combination.</p>
<p>Simply positioned, Scrum is an agile technique of iterative and incremental product transport that makes use of common remarks and collaborative selection making.</p>
<p>History
Scrum is primarily based totally on a 1986 paper written via way of means of Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka for the Harvard Business Review titled “The New New Product Development Game.” In this paper, the authors used the game of rugby as a metaphor to explain the blessings of self-organizing groups in progressive product improvement and transport. Jeff Sutherland, Ken Schwaber, and Mike Beedle took the thoughts from this paper, along with the metaphor, and carried out it to their area of software program improvement. They referred to as their new technique Scrum, after the rugby time period that describes how groups shape a circle and opt for the ball to get it lower back into play again. They first carried out this technique at Easel Corporation in 1993. Schwaber and Beedle wrote approximately their reports of their ee-e book Agile Software Development with Scrum in 2002, accompanied via way of means of Schwaber&rsquo;s ee-e book Agile Project Management with Scrum in 2004, which protected the paintings Schwaber had achieved with Primavera.</p>
<p>The Scrum Framework
Schwaber refers to Scrum as a framework and now no longer a methodology. This is generally because of the connotations across the phrase methodology, which many infer as prescriptive in nature. By contrast, Scrum actually offers a shape for transport, however does now no longer let you know a way to do precise practices, leaving that to the group to decide. Exhibit 1 suggests the simple Scrum framework.</p>
<p>The Original Scrum Framework
Exhibit 1. The Original Scrum Framework</p>
<p>The assignment starts offevolved with a clean imaginative and prescient supplied via way of means of the commercial enterprise, and a fixed of product capabilities so as of importance. These capabilities are a part of the product backlog, that is maintained via way of means of the patron or patron consultant called the Product Owner. A time container normally called an new release or dash, is the set quantity of time that the group has to finish the capabilities selected. Sprints are commonly from one to 4 weeks in period, and that period is maintained for the duration of the existence of the assignment so that you can set up a cadence. The group selects gadgets from the product backlog that it believes may be finished withinside the dash, and creates a dash backlog inclusive of the capabilities and duties as a part of the dash-making plans assembly.</p>
<p>Once the group has devoted to a dash backlog, the assignment paintings starts offevolved. During this time withinside the dash, the group is covered from interruptions and allowed to consciousness on assembly the dash goal. No adjustments to the dash backlog are allowed; however, the product backlog may be modified in education for the subsequent dash.</p>
<p>During the dash, the group exams in every day with every different withinside the shape of a 15-minute assembly called a scrum. The group stands in a circle and every member states what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and what&rsquo;s stepping into their manner.</p>
<p>At the cease of the dash, the group demos the paintings they&rsquo;ve finished to the stakeholders and gathers remarks a good way to have an effect on what they paintings on withinside the subsequent dash. They additionally preserve a retrospective to discover ways to improve. This assembly is crucial, as its consciousness is at the 3 pillars of Scrum: transparency, inspection, and model.</p>
<p>Roles and Responsibilities
There are most effective 3 roles in Scrum: the ScrumMaster, the Product Owner, and the Team.</p>
<p>The ScrumMaster is the keeper of the technique, the advise for the group, and the protector of the group. They take away barriers, facilitate group communication, mediate discussions withinside the group and negotiate with the ones outside to the group. Above all, they exist in carrier to the group.</p>
<p>The Product Owner represents the voice of the patron and has the authority to make choices approximately the product. This man or woman owns the product backlog and is liable for speaking the imaginative and prescient to the group, and defining and prioritizing backlog gadgets. The Product Owner works with the group on a every day foundation to reply questions and offer product guidance.</p>
<p>The Team includes seven plus or minus  individuals who are at the same time liable for the transport of the product. They very own the estimates, make assignment commitments, and document every day reputation to every different withinside the every day scrum. They are self-organizing, which means that shape seems with out express intervention from the outside. In different phrases, the group owns the way it chooses to construct product capabilities—the group owns the “how,” at the same time as the Product Owner owns the “what.”</p>
<p>The Application of Scrum
Scrum is carried out via way of means of following a fixed of ceremonies, or conferences. Required Scrum ceremonies encompass the dash making plans assembly, the every day scrum, the dash assessment and the dash retrospective. Working in time packing containers referred to as sprints is likewise required. Release making plans conferences are optionally available and permit for the making plans and forecasting of companies of sprints.</p>
<p>Sprint Planning Meeting
The dash-making plans assembly is hung on the primary day of each dash. The ScrumMaster, Product Owner, and Team are all in attendance. The Product Owner provides the set of capabilities she or he would really like to peer finished withinside the dash (the “what”) then the group determines the duties had to put in force those capabilities (the “how”). Work estimates are reviewed to peer if the group has the time to finish all of the capabilities asked withinside the dash. If so, the group commits to the dash. If now no longer, the decrease precedence capabilities cross lower back into the product backlog, till the workload for the dash is small sufficient to reap the group&rsquo;s commitment.</p>
<p>Tracking Progress
Once the dash-making plans assembly is entire and the group has made a commitment, the group starts offevolved to song its development the usage of fantastically seen records radiators. These radiators encompass the burndown chart and the assignment board.</p>
<p>The assignment board is utilized by the group to song the development of the duties for every characteristic. The minimal columns used are To Do, Doing, and Done. Teams can have their every day scrum assembly on the assignment board, and circulate gadgets throughout the board whilst pointing out what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and what barriers they&rsquo;re grappling with. See Exhibit 2 for an instance assignment board for a software program improvement assignment.</p>

<p>The burndown chart suggests the fashion line of the quantity of labor left to do withinside the dash. The x-axis is the range of days withinside the dash, and the y-axis is the range of hours for all of the duties that had been described withinside the dash-making plans assembly. Over the times of the dash, the road indicating the quantity of labor left to do ought to fashion right all the way down to 0 via way of means of the closing day of the dash. See Exhibit three for a dash burndown chart instance.</p>
<p>Sprint Burndown Chart Example
Exhibit three. Sprint Burndown Chart Example</p>
<p>Sprint development is tracked the usage of the burndown chart, the assignment board, and the every day scrum. In combination, those 3 matters can offer a clean image of what is being labored on, what is finished, what is nevertheless to be achieved, whether or not or now no longer it&rsquo;ll be finished in time, and what is probably stopping the group from assembly its dash and/or launch goal.</p>
<p>Sprint Review
At the cease of the dash, the group invitations stakeholders to a dash assessment assembly wherein the capabilities that had been finished withinside the dash are demo&rsquo;d and remarks is asked. The Product Owner continues song of the remarks and includes it as wished into the product backlog.</p>
<p>Once the assessment is entire, the group (with out the stakeholders) conducts a retrospective to decide what they did properly that they desire to preserve doing, what they struggled with, and what pointers they&rsquo;ve for extrade going forward. An movement plan is created and those gadgets are applied over the path of the subsequent dash, and reviewed for efficacy withinside the subsequent dash retrospective.</p>
<p>Release Planning
Release Planning is likewise a part of Scrum, and is a manner to do lengthy-time period making plans for a time container that includes a couple of sprints. This is regularly achieved quarterly, and the effects of the area do now no longer ought to be a launch to the patron, however can also additionally actually be an inner launch to affirm machine integration and validation. Exhibit four suggests how launch making plans suits in with the relaxation of the Scrum framework.</p>
<p>The whole group attends the launch-making plans assembly, wherein the Product Owner provides the capabilities she/he would really like to peer finished withinside the area. The group does now no longer assignment out those capabilities however, however alternatively offers gross degree estimates to decide what capabilities may be achieved in what dash, and the way lots of those capabilities may be finished via way of means of the cease of the area. Release making plans may be characteristic-driven (what number of sprints will it take to finish this set of capabilities?), time-driven (what number of capabilities are we able to assume to have finished via way of means of this deadline?) or value-driven (given this budget, what does our time table appear to be and what capabilities can we have achieved earlier than we run out of money?).</p>

<p>Some Scrum Examples
Scrum is not unusualplace in software program improvement tasks and myriad examples may be observed via easy Google research. What is much less apparent is the usage of Scrum in non-software program tasks, so some of those examples are noted withinside the following.</p>
<p>Writing a Book Using Scrum
My colleague Stacia Viscardi and I used Scrum to manipulate our ee-e book assignment. Our product backlog consisted of the chapters we desired to write down for The Software Project Manager&rsquo;s Bridge to Agility, in precedence order primarily based totally on patron inquiries. For instance, due to the fact we regarded to get a number of questions on scope control and only a few concerning procurement, the bankruptcy on scope changed into on the pinnacle of the backlog, at the same time as the procurement bankruptcy changed into close to the bottom.</p>
<p>We held a launch-making plans assembly and moved the backlog gadgets onto turn chart pages that represented our sprints, which had been one month in period. At the start of every dash, we held a name to speak approximately the chapters we might be writing, set desires and expectations, and commit. During the dash, we checked in with every different numerous instances a week. As we finished chapters withinside the dash we might trade them to get remarks, after which include that remarks into the very last copy. Our dash critiques consisted of a very last assessment of the chapters, and any extra adjustments ended up withinside the product backlog to be deliberate withinside the subsequent dash.</p>
<p>As it changed into simply the 2 of us, we turned around roles and responsibilities. For one phase of the ee-e book, I changed into dubbed the Product Owner, and I had very last characteristic authority. For different sections, Stacia had this function. Our ScrumMaster changed into our editor, despite the fact that he did now no longer recognise it. He nevertheless finished the ScrumMaster responsibilities, however, he reminded us of our deadlines, eliminated barriers for us, and gave us the help and gear we had to do our jobs.</p>
<p>And it is now no longer simply us the usage of Scrum to write down books. Lonely Planet makes use of Scrum of their journey manual improvement, “Prior to Scrum, the improvement of a ee-e book changed into very sequential and required many handoffs and took a protracted a time to get a ee-e book out from thought to publication. Now they contain all gamers had to positioned a ee-e book together (writers, photograph artists, computing device publishing, marketing, editors etc) and incrementally increase the ee-e book bankruptcy via way of means of bankruptcy following the Scrum framework” (Scrum for Non-Software Projects, 2010).</p>
<p>Using Scrum in a Venture Capital Company
Jeff Sutherland is a Senior Advisor at Openview Venture Partners, a undertaking capital employer primarily based totally in Boston, MA. In 2010, he wrote a paper for the Hawaii International Conference on Systems Science titled Organizational Transformation with Scrum: How a Venture Capital Group Gets Twice as Much Done With Half the Work that describes how Openview makes use of Scrum withinside the control of its portfolio.</p>
<p>Openview groups use Scrum in tasks “in control, sales, marketing, finance, and customer service for portfolio companies,” in addition to pushing Scrum out to their portfolio companies (Sutherland, 2010, p. 1). In one instance of Scrum use, the Labs group use one-week sprints to execute operational cost-upload tasks for his or her portfolio companies, carry out due diligence, and institutionalize their cost-upload capabilities.</p>
<p>When the Labs group to begin with applied Scrum, the elevated visibility into tasks underway made them recognise that numerous of the tasks had been without a doubt low-cost. As a result, they reduce 30 percentage in their tasks, which made room for extra high-cost tasks and allowed them to consciousness on and end those tasks. In fact, this readability of consciousness and the restriction of the quantity of labor in development in a dash helped the group to grow to be extra productive, as tasks now no longer dragged out over lengthy durations of time due to the fact too many had been being labored simultaneously. The group has already doubled their productiveness and is “on their manner to the second one doubling of productiveness” as they preserve to adapt (Sutherland, 2010, p. 8).</p>
<p>Scrum in Church
Rev. Arline Sutherland works as an meantime pastor for the Unitarian Universalist church. She is likewise the spouse of Jeff Sutherland, one of the co-creators of Scrum. In a 2009 paper for the Agile2009 Conference titled Scrum in Church: Saving the World One Team at a Time, Rev. Sutherland defined her reports the usage of Scrum in church buildings in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Florida, Delaware, and Virginia.</p>
<p>Scrum is generally utilized by workplace personnel and volunteers to each “hold the engine running” and in “new initiatives” (Sutherland, 2009, p. three). Projects below diverse programming regions consisting of pastoral care, kids and youth, club improvement, social justice, music, facilities, budget and fund elevating had been controlled the usage of Scrum.</p>
<p>Several variations had been made in every example to house the wishes of the group contributors and the limitations in their environment. For instance, it changed into not possible to preserve every day in-man or woman stand-ups with extra than 1/2 of the group conserving down day jobs. So Skype changed into used since “the most important demographic the usage of Skype are grandparents, (and) even older much less technologically state-of-the-art contributors are regularly professional users” (Sutherland, 2009, p.four).</p>
<p>It is really well worth noting that Sutherland discovered “that every and each time Scrum is delivered right into a machine it needs to be adapted” (Sutherland, 2009, p. four). Originally discouraged that her implementations of Scrum by no means regarded to suit the correct of “actual Scrum,” she fast found out that the blessings of real adaptive extrade protected the model of Scrum itself.</p>
<p>What Happened To…?
Because that is most effective a brief review of Scrum, it&rsquo;s far anticipated that the reader can also additionally depart with numerous unanswered questions. In this phase, we can have a take a observe the pinnacle 3 questions most customarily requested via way of means of the ones new to agile and Scrum, then depart you with a few very last phrases on wherein to discover extra records.</p>
<p>What Happened to Gantt Charts and Other Documentation?
Gantt charts aren&rsquo;t normally used on Scrum tasks. Burndown charts (each dash burndowns and launch burndowns), assignment boards, backlogs, dash plans, launch plans, and different metrics charts are used alternatively to talk development, reputation, and forecasts. A kind of agile assignment control gear exist to offer this form of dashboard reporting, along with plug-ins for Microsoft Project.</p>
<p>The most effective artifacts Scrum calls for are the product backlog, dash backlog, launch burndown, and dash burndown. All different varieties of documentation are left as much as the group to decide. The agile rule of thumb is if the artifact provides cost and the patron is inclined to pay for it, then the artifact ought to be created. Artifacts created due to the fact “it is at the checklist” or “we’ve usually achieved this” are gadgets that ought to be taken into consideration for elimination. Documents required for governance issues (audits, accounting, etc.) have to nevertheless be created, however regularly may be streamlined.</p>
<p>What Happened to the Project Manager?
The assignment supervisor regularly will become the ScrumMaster. This isn&rsquo;t always usually the case and there are numerous exclusive transformation permutations. For instance, a assignment supervisor who has been serving as a website or situation count number professional is probably higher located because the Product Owner. Or a assignment supervisor heading up a group of 50+ humans can also additionally continue to be in that function and consciousness on general assignment duties consisting of procurement and agreement negotiation, at the same time as the Scrum groups at the assignment (remember, a Scrum group is 7 +/- 2 humans, so a 50-man or woman assignment can be made from 6-10 Scrum groups) every have their very own ScrumMaster. In this situation the assignment supervisor assists the ScrumMasters in coordinating, strategizing, and putting off roadblocks.</p>
<p>What Happened to Using Detailed Tasks and Task Estimates to Generate Projections?
Traditional estimating and making plans makes use of a bottom-up technique, wherein all necessities have to be absolutely described, with duties then created and expected primarily based totally in this constant scope. Agile estimating and making plans alternatively makes use of a pinnacle-down technique to forecast. Gross degree estimating on the characteristic degree is regularly achieved the usage of a way referred to as making plans poker, with estimates given in factors the usage of the Fibonacci sequence. Teams decide their speed in factors, i.e. what number of factors on common can the group entire in a dash. Cost consistent with factor is decided via way of means of calculating the loaded salaries of the group for length x, then dividing that via way of means of the range of factors finished in length x. Once you&rsquo;ve got got your group&rsquo;s common speed and a gross-expected product backlog, you could forecast assignment milestones and crowning glory dates, in addition to the value consistent with factor and for that reason forecast assignment value.</p>
<p>One paragraph can not try this subject matter justice, as whole books were written in this subject matter. An great ee-e book with sensible recommendation on a way to do estimating the usage of making plans poker and forecasting the usage of speed and factors is Agile Estimating and Planning via way of means of Mike Cohn.</p>
<p>Final Words
Scrum is an agile assignment control framework that enables groups to supply valued merchandise iteratively and incrementally, at the same time as constantly examining and adapting the technique. Project Management Institute contributors will discover they could put in force Scrum and nevertheless be in line with the A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide)—Fourth Edition, as each advise a plan-do-check-act technique to assignment control.</p>
<p>This changed into a brief review of Scrum, and as such did now no longer cope with many extra regions of hobby consisting of product roadmaps, estimating the usage of factors, consumer stories, tale maps, and so forth. These agile practices are regularly used along with Scrum, as are different methodologies, consisting of Kanban and XP. Additional assets on those subjects are to be had online, many for free.
