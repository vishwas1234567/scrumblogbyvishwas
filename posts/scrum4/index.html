  <p>If you’ve in no way heard of it earlier than, the Scaled Agile Framework for Enterprise is a group of ideas and practices assembled with the aim of providing a manner to “scale up” an Agile operating version for massive organizations.
If you want it, I actually have a refresher on what Agile is and isn’t right here.
Since its inception in 2011, SAFe has skilled full-size growth. Almost 1/2 of one million humans international have emerge as licensed SAFe practitioners. If you count on to paintings in product, layout, or engineering at a massive employer — or maybe a developing startup — there’s a risk you’ll stumble upon SAFe sooner or later to your career.
A graph that indicates a fashion that will increase upwards nearly linearly.
Google seek time period hobby for “SAFe agile” when you consider that 2011
Spoiler alert: I’m now no longer a fan.
In truth, as you could have guessed from the name of this article, I truly suppose SAFe could be very horrific. It publicizes values that appear practical after which turns round and imposes approaches and shape that stifle actual agility. There are a variety of of “scaling frameworks” obtainable of various quality, however it’s SAFe especially that exemplifies the worst of misunderstood and poorly carried out Agile wondering. It’s really well worth paying interest to — even simply as an instance of what to avoid.
You have to deal with this stance for what it&rsquo;s miles: one Product Designer’s person perspective. I can’t conclusively show that SAFe is the incorrect desire for all situations. What I can do is lift attention approximately the usually expressed criticisms that corroborate with what I’ve found out myself and heard from others in my network.
I additionally desire to attract a clean connection among the excessive degree criticisms and the low degree structural information of the framework. This would require a few rationalization of these information. The precise information is, there’s a photo that explains the entirety in a simple, intuitive manner:
An intimidating and complicated photo laying out roles and approaches
…or perhaps now no longer.
If you’d as an alternative SAFe communicate for itself you could use the hyperlink above. There’s loads of pages of documentation, hours of videos, 15 exclusive schooling courses, and extra. If that seems like a bit tons, I’ll do my satisfactory to offer a few rationalization of the way SAFe works as I undergo every factor.
SAFe permits bureaucratic, pinnacle-down manipulate
At the very best degree, known as the “Portfolio”, SAFe does endorse investment indefinite “Value Streams” — which typically constitute a product, product line, or consumer type. However, the Lean Portfolio Management characteristic (LPM) that controls investment (in all likelihood the equal humans formerly answerable for waterfall-fashion undertaking budgets), are given sole authority to approve which Portfolio Epics (massive initiatives) circulate into every stream. Epics aren&rsquo;t causes approximately a trouble that desires to be solved. They are pre-shaped thoughts approximately how satisfactory to remedy the ones issues.
Right away we will see symptoms and symptoms of the old-college attitude of viewing groups as a “delivery” characteristic rather than a strategic one. The excessive degree thinkers give you thoughts, and the low degree doers execute on the ones thoughts. Ignored is the opportunity that the ones closest to the paintings is probably satisfactory ready to make choices approximately it. Escaping from this faulty attitude is a center aim of Agile wondering that SAFe fails to remotely accomplish.
A comparable difficulty pops up once more whilst we examine a barely decrease degree.
SAFe collects small product groups (regularly Scrum groups) into “Agile Release Trains” — organizations of groups with an extra layer of control roles spanning every institution at what&rsquo;s known as the “Program degree”.
Generally those roles hinder the autonomy of groups. They upload manner and verbal exchange overhead out of percentage with the price they offer.
These roles encompass a Product Manager (PM), a System Architect (SA), and a Release Train Engineer (RTE).
The SA and PM outline and split large portions of labor (regularly inherited from the portfolio manner above) after which byskip the portions into the groups.
The Product Owner and group may theoretically be capable of prioritize different, smaller portions of labor towards the paintings imposed on them, however those efforts have confined visibility and buy-in from above. There could be a herbal strain to deal with paintings coming from the very best factor as maximum vital — despite the fact that each unmarried group member believes different gadgets could be extra treasured. Because of this, the function of the Product Owner is decreased to writing memories and checking recognition criteria, rather than being the unmarried factor of duty for product management that become the unique goal for the function.
The System Architect isn&rsquo;t always in a role to be near the real engineering paintings, so the architectural plan they byskip on can be disconnected from the fact of the paintings. These varieties of roles had been a trademark of big-layout-up-the front waterfall tasks and are nicely preserved in SAFe.
Release Train Engineers outline steady cross-group manner and cadence, and deal with many operational tasks. Ultimately this leaves much less room for person groups to modify, improve, or test with their very own practices in any manner that deviates from mounted standards.
Sometimes all of those issues are repeated once more with the addition of a “Large Solution Level” — organizations of organizations of groups with analogous roles to the ones on the application degree, however spanning Release Trains. When this takes place the equal issues are in all likelihood to be repeated, however the Solution Level does appear to be much less usually installed place.
SAFe (regularly) comes bundled with Rally — FURTHER proscribing group autonomy
SAFe is usually a bundle address the undertaking control software program Rally. Rally is the type of software program you’d count on a employer the use of SAFe to make — it’s overloaded with features, unfocused, confusing, unstable, and therefore hard to research and use.
The price proposition of adopting Rally for management is that they’ll be capable of see reporting that offers them a simple, unified image of the development and issues throughout the complete corporation.
Of direction, this indicates anybody withinside the corporation now no longer handiest desires to apply Rally, however they want to apply it in a steady manner. Again, this could handiest be completed thru pinnacle-down dictation. Rally and the manner it thinks approximately paintings are pressured onto all groups irrespective of their preference, context, or buy-in. To truly have all of the facts roll up calls for notable overhead in estimating and monitoring that slows the entirety down and may be extraordinarily disruptive to truly getting paintings executed.
Additionally, the pinnacle degree reporting isn’t even mainly useful. It makes a speciality of the matters Rally tracks— metrics just like the extent of tale factors delivered (actually made up) or the amount of insects addressed (a horrible degree for “product quality”). If control ignores those stats, the overhead they upload could be for nothing. If they control to the metrics, the stats could be fudged in order that groups appearance precise and are left by myself. Estimates could be over-padded, small portions of labor could be exaggerated, and this could without problems result in a breakdown of trust.
SAFe takes the worst viable method to coping with dependencies
A dependency is an example wherein a group desires to look forward to some thing to be executed some place else earlier than they are able to entire their very own paintings. SAFe is based round a backwards mind-set that dependencies are an immutable truth of existence that have to be universal and controlled round. It even every so often refers to them as a strategic gain. In fact, whilst you think about dependencies as a horrific component — to be minimized at each opportunity — you could locate that the ones possibilities are abundant and that taking gain of them effects in the main in benefits. Here are only a few recommendations that SAFe under-emphasizes or totally ignores:
Encourage a subculture of inner-sourcing wherein one group can publish paintings to some other group’s code base while not having to rely upon them past accepting the merge
Make it clean for group individuals to briefly or completely change groups whilst it makes experience to do so
Focus on hiring, structuring, and schooling groups to address their very own desires with out out of doors help
How SAFe truly chooses to control dependencies is with the aid of using growing attention on making plans, manner, hierarchy, and standardization. Predictably, this effects in plenty of conferences that intrude with the cappotential to get paintings executed. It imposes this method thru a commonplace roll-out that influences the complete agency at once. No attention is given to which regions might have been self sustaining with out the extra burdensome shape.
SAFe is excessively orientated round making plans
A center characteristic of SAFe is the concept of ~10 week Program Increments (PIs). You can suppose of those type of like large sprints that include all your ordinary sprints.
Each PI starts offevolved with a PI making plans occasion that runs for approximately  days. PI making plans additionally calls for pre-making plans and post-making plans sports on the Program degree.
There is surely a few price in having humans get collectively in character to construct relationships, proportion facts, and orient round goals. On the alternative hand, the use of that confined time window to make 10 week plans of precise consumer memories primarily based totally on pre-described features, after which requiring dedication to the ones plans is tons much less treasured.
A time table with activities associated ordinarily to making plans
The encouraged general -day PI Planning agenda
As quickly as PI making plans ends, the ones plans created primarily based totally on confined expertise and severa assumptions becomes out of date as quickly as some thing new is found out. Teams could be constantly torn among sticking to the plan they’ve found out doesn’t make experience and and reorienting expectancies for motives the ones above them might not be in a role to understand.
SAFe is orientated round extent, now no longer price
In all this attention on extent metrics, estimation, and churning paintings thru the pipeline, the idea of what’s truly treasured or a success is without problems lost. It’s regularly assumed that extra paintings shipped out the door should be “price”, despite the fact that the enjoy of the product is truly struggling and customers aren&rsquo;t taking advantage of the extra features.
SAFe is privy to the complaint that it isn&rsquo;t always price targeted and has these days brought “layout wondering”, “consumer centricity”, and different ideas to its documentation to compensate. So some distance I’m now no longer satisfied it makes any extensive adjustments in its manner that truly make room for the ones matters, and it fumbles in even expertise them withinside the first place.
For example, SAFe’s definition of “customers” leaves the door open to defining commercial enterprise stakeholders or the ones investment the price streams as being “customers”. This could be very exclusive from reorienting anybody (consisting of the ones presenting the investment) to attention at the desires of the cease-customers truly the use of the software program, a center detail of layout wondering.
SAFe is unnecessarily complicated
SAFe has a herbal gain that protects it from complaint; It is so complex that it’s hard to absolutely comprehend. Despite the extra time I’ve spent gaining knowledge of the framework, I’m probable nevertheless in all likelihood to get a few matters incorrect or leave out a few vital factors. However, an abundance of complexity is itself a valid concern. SAFe has such a lot of conferences, checkpoints, values, and strategies that it’s essentially not possible to get anybody at the equal web page.
SAFe limits retrospectives and non-stop development
Roles on the application degree and above can&rsquo;t likely attend all group retrospectives. This approach retrospectives will now no longer be immediately heard with the aid of using the folks that can truly alternate some of the matters being discussed.
The manner SAFe attempts to make amends for this isn&rsquo;t always sufficient.
PI making plans is the handiest time wherein anybody in a Release Train is assured to be collectively in-character. Unfortunately it incorporates a quick retrospective associated handiest to the fulfillment of the making plans occasion itself.
SAFe does encompass an “Inspect and Adapt” occasion toward the cease of every PI, however it appears nearly designed to be skipped primarily based totally on how difficult it&rsquo;s miles to coordinate for the RTE. When held, the occasion is primed with the aid of using reviewing — of direction — extent metrics from the final PI. Additionally handiest half-hour of the occasion are allocated for an real retrospective wherein problems are surfaced and agreed upon. If this time is cut up flippantly amongst all of the individuals of a one hundred character Release Train, then every player gets approximately 18 seconds each ~10 weeks to deliver up problems in a context wherein they could truly be heard.
SAFe additionally has a few different factors like “evaluation charts” wherein groups are surveyed extra widely, however those lean closely toward confirming that SAFe practices are being followed, now no longer whether or not or now no longer they’re effective.
SAFe degrades the ideas it aggregates
A key a part of SAFe that I actually have now no longer but touched on is the aggregation of current ideas like Scrum, Kanban, Lean Product, Lean UX, and DevOPs.
If you’re unfamiliar, I’d recommend exploring every idea independently through the years instead of all at once. Many are treasured themselves, however SAFe doesn’t do a incredible activity at truly synthesizing them and may every so often upload confusion. Case in factor:
SAFe automatically espouses how its practices follow “Lean-Agile” ideas. The trick is that “Lean-Agile” doesn’t truly confer with “Lean” or “Agile” ideas.
Instead “Lean-Agile Principles” are a advent of SAFe’s very own layout. This new set of “ideas” warps the ideas it assimilates. For example, the web page approximately decentralizing choices (ranked the bottom of all ideas) subtly subverts itself with the aid of using emphasizing the significance of centralizing decision-making for plenty use-cases. Other indexed ideas have comparable issues. For someone being added to all of this facts at once, the real which means of the unique ideas can be lost.
SAFe isn&rsquo;t always Agile
By now some of the methods SAFe is inconsistent with an Agile attitude have to be quite clean. It’s plan targeted, bureaucratic, complex, consists of a number of regularly pointless manner, dis-empowers group autonomy, and extra.
But does it be counted whether or not or now no longer SAFe is Agile whilst what we certainly care approximately is effectiveness?
Yes. It does.
Agile ideas are handiest Agile ideas due to the fact they had been typically identified and agreed on as being effective. That wondering resonated with a broader network of practitioners that&rsquo;s why the motion at first took off. If you suspect agility is a predictor of effectiveness, (a perception possibly in the back of a number of the hobby in SAFe) then it subjects pretty a chunk if SAFe is steady with Agile wondering. Misleading humans approximately what they’re shopping for is a horrific component and it isn’t incorrect to name that out.
What approximately all of the case research wherein SAFe is proven to have worked?
There are approximately forty case research on a success SAFe adoption on scaledagileframework.com. The case research for disasters are conspicuously absent. Contrary to the acronym, SAFe entails simultaneous adjustments to a large new manner throughout an full-size ecosystem— a huge risk. Unless every of these forty a success organizations every had 11,250 licensed SAFe practitioners there are pretty some organizations we’re now no longer listening to from.
Also, I don’t placed tons an excessive amount of inventory withinside the case research that do exist. Even if the extent metrics they attention on certainly had been treasured it’s clean to cherry select out some stats that make it look like matters went nicely.
To attention in on a particular example, let’s check an excerpt from the case look at approximately SAFe implementation at Fitbit:
In 2016, client era employer, Fitbit, launched 4 new merchandise to the marketplace that had been definitely obtained with the aid of using consumers, and shipped over 22 million devices. Delivering its maximum variety of merchandise in a 12 months is due in component to the employer’s dedication to, and fulfillment in adopting SAFe® (Scaled Agile Framework®) as a manner to scale the group to satisfy goal dates.
© Scaled Agile, Inc.
Here’s Fitbit’s inventory rate over the past 5 years:
A inventory chart that is going down sharply at the start of 2016 and maintains downwards
Yeah… 2016 seems like a incredible 12 months for Fitbit.
Now, we will’t certainly characteristic the downfall of Fitbit to SAFe adoption with the quantity of facts we have. But if a employer can battle this tons and nevertheless hail SAFe adoption as enhancing the responsiveness in their product choices, I’m going to slender my eyes some tiers extra whilst finding out the relaxation of the case research.
It’s OK as a transitional step aleven though, right?
If you’re a person who could make this argument you then definately should suppose that SAFe desires to be transitioned away from. On this factor we agree!
To make that transition we are able to of direction must spend a while declaring the components that don’t paintings nicely.
Is that some thing you’ve been spending a number of time on?
Even in case you are, SAFe is installation in a manner that forestalls you from truly transitioning. The authority it locations withinside the arms of control acts as a legitimization of the pinnacle-down manipulate mentality. This pairs poorly with the missing strategies for manner development we’ve already covered. The authority to “customize” SAFe to the proper context is ordinarily unavailable to the real groups satisfactory located to understand what isn’t operating.
Nowhere withinside the SAFe road-map does it truly confer with any of its center practices as transitional. If it’s a transitional framework, then it does a quite negative activity of presenting any sort of transition plan.
A roadmap with crimson circles drawn at each stage
The SAFe Implementation Roadmap with circles brought to all of the factors wherein representative offerings are needed
The hyper-attention on certifications additionally hurts the framework’s flexibility. If you spend hours and hours operating to emerge as licensed, the certification emerge as part of your very own price. A transition to some thing that appears much less like SAFe might also additionally look like it threatens that price. I can’t blame every person for purchasing licensed in a activity marketplace wherein certifications be counted. But the ones people have a specific obligation to take note of the downsides of SAFe and viable methods to enhance or deviate from it.
These issues are widely skilled
I‘m now no longer by myself in expressing a lot of those criticisms — aleven though I desire I’ve long gone a chunk in addition in connecting them to the precise practices withinside the framework. If you’re seeking out corroborating testimonies, right here are some:
Ken Schwaber, co-developer of Scrum expressed severe issues approximately SAFe as early as 2013.
Nicholas M. Chaillan, U.S. Air Force Chief Software Officer, discourages “the use of rigid, prescriptive frameworks consisting of the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe).”
Forbes contributor Steve Denning calls out SAFe for being “ mainly worrying” in his article on a way to spot faux Agile.
Marty Cagan of the Silicon Valley Product Group explains how SAFe is antithetical to the attitude of Silicon Valley organizations.</p>
<p>Jared Spool, Co-Founder and Co-CEO at Center Centre-UIE</p>
<p>Jeff Gothelf, Co-creator of Lean UX</p>
<p>Allen Holub, Agile Consultant &amp; Computer Scientist</p>
<p>Some stupid meme account
Stay secure obtainable (now no longer SAFe)
While SAFe has without a doubt obtained a bargain of complaint, my non-public experience is this complaint might not have reached a massive target target market past sure on line circles. This is specially in all likelihood whilst taken into consideration along the growing variety of organizations adopting the framework each day.
For many humans, the concept that there’s some thing incorrect with SAFe— or that it conflicts with Agile ideas at all — can be absolutely novel.
Increased dialogue aimed toward a broader target target market can probable help. I desire to the touch in this subject matter extra withinside the destiny and to element what different options are obtainable.
For now, even in case you aren’t operating in a SAFe environment, that’s now no longer an excuse to get complacent. The issues I’ve laid out right here have to be taken as a broader warning — even the maximum practical of thoughts can without problems be co-opted, corrupted, and burdened in case you’re now no longer paying near interest.</p>
